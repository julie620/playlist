## Lab 3 - Playlist

This program allows you to play a playlist of songs

## Program Description

By adding WAV files to the Songs folder (in the src folder), the songs will be played. Features include: pause, resume, restart, previous, skip, and jump to specific time. If you have MP3 files you can put it into the MP3 folder (in src folder) and they will be converted to WAV when you run the program.(WARNING - it deletes the MP3 after conversion)

## IMPORTANT NOTES

* Certain combinations of choices may cause the program to stop working as intended
* When a song finishes, it will NOT automatically play the next song; it is still awaiting input through Scanner so you have to enter something (I strongly recommend the skip option)
* The jump to specfic time option is a little tempermental and can be hard to use

## Topics Used
* Arrays

## Extra
* Python Script (MP3 -> WAV)
* File Handling (AudioInputStream)
